    <h2>ICHA TEA</h2>
    <!-- description -->
    <p>
      Icha tea is the perfect place to wind down with your friends. They have authentic tea that will wind you down and have a peaceful time.
      <br><br/>
      Not only that it is great catching up, it was also really great for those who want to study but it could get busy after 3pm.
      <br><br/>
      A huge plus for dog owners is that it is dog friendly but not as much during busy times where it can get a bit squishy.
      <br><br/>
      Location: 235 Spadina Ave. Unit 4 <br>

<h2>NEO COFFEE BAR</h2>

  <p>
    Neo Cafe Bar is one of my top cafes to work at. They not only have amazing coffee but they also have authentic Janapense tea. 
    <br><br/>
    When you step inside you will istantly feel like you are in a luxurious cafe with the wood and warm lights around.
    <br><br/>
    A huge plus for dog owners is that it is dog friendly but not as much during busy times where it can get a bit squishy.
